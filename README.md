💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a supervised machine learning approach. It leverages historical transaction data to build a predictive model that identifies potentially fraudulent behavior.

📌 Objective
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or genuine, helping reduce financial loss and improve security.

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection

The dataset contains 284,807 transactions, with 492 fraudulent cases.

Features are numerical, the result of a PCA transformation (V1 to V28), along with Time, Amount, and the target variable Class:

Class = 1: Fraud

Class = 0: Non-Fraud

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

🚀 Workflow
Data exploration and cleaning

Handling class imbalance (using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling)

Feature scaling

Model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Model evaluation using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion Matrix

Result analysis and visualization

📊 Model Evaluation
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	99.2%	83%	91%	87%
Random Forest	99.4%	89%	92%	90%

✅ Results
The final model successfully identifies a high percentage of fraudulent transactions with minimal false positives, which is crucial for financial applications.
